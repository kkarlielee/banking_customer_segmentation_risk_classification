# Bank Customer Segmentation and Loan Classification
In this project, I use a comprehensive dataset sourced from a retail bank, consisting of a total of 8 datasets. These datasets are an enhanced variant of the Beka Dataset - the original database was published by Berka (2000). The Beka Database is the financial dataset of a bank in the Czech Republic. It contains data of over 5300 customers with nearly 1,000,000 transactions. Also, the bank granted 700 loans and issued approximately 900 credit cards.

The purpose of this project is to:

* Customer Segmentation: Cluster customers into different groups. (K Means Clustering)
* Risk Classification: Build a model to classify loans. (Logistics Regression)
